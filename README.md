# Web-App for Budgeting 

This is a simple website meant to organize and store budgeting plans. Excel is an incredibly useful tool for this, however the usage of formulas and the UI are intimidating for some. The goal of this website is to bridge that gap. 

If done properly, it should provide clean and readable budget boxes that take care of all the formulas and conversions one would expect in a budgeting plan (day/week/yearly breakdowns, providing totals compared against an inputted salary, etc.)

*This also serves as a convenient way for me to learn React.*
