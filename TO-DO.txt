TO-DO:
    - Cost adjustment checkboxes (adjust relative to the selected weekly/monthly/yearly)
    - Boxes
        - Movable components at some point
    - Budget area
        - Movable components as well
        - Formatting/CSS work
    - Info area on the side
        - Should this be part of the Budget Area? (or would that be more of a headache)
        - Salary field
        - Money saving/"vacation" field
    - Local storage so that refresh doesn't lose all the progress
        - Way to reset all?
    - toLocaleString for money conversion
    - Base level css formatting (margins on the sides, boxes go left to right, etc.)
        - grid, flexbox
    
DONE:
    ✓ Deletion
    ✓ Budget Area button that creates the Boxes
    ✓ Stateful Budget Area and Boxes
    ✓ Editable name and value associated with said name
    - Boxes
        ✓ Total at the bottom
        ✓ Maybe reconsider the design of a "Box"
            ✓ Multiple components within a single box in of itself
        ✓ Input type of number on the side
    ✓ PARENT TO CHILD INTERACTIONS
        ✓ Make the data used in the parent component predicated on Child Props, such that when the values are changed
        it should automatically update - there are good tutorials on this
